        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
        <header>Elements</header>
        <img src="images/grumpy-cat-small.png" />
        <ul>The anatomy of our element is:
          <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
          <li>The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
          <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_Elements">
        <header>Nesting Elements</header>
        <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
        <p><code>&lt;<span class="green">p</span>&gt;My cat is &lt;<span class="green">strong</span>&gt;very&lt;<span class="green">/strong</span>&gt; grumpy.&lt;<span class="green">/p</span>&gt;</code></p>
        <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the <code>p</code> element first, then opened the <code>strong</code> element. For proper nesting, we should close the <code>strong</code> element first, before closing the <code>p</code>.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Void_Elements">
        <header>Void Elements</header>
        <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called void elements.</p>
        <p>For example, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element embeds an image file onto a page:</p>
        <p><code>&lt;<span class="green">img</span>
  <span class="red">src</span>="<span class="green">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png</span>"
  <span class="red">alt</span>="<span class="green">Firefox icon</span>" /&gt;
</code></p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <header>Attributes</header>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
        <img src="images/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" />
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the <strong><code>class</code></strong> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
<p>An attribute should have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
  <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
  <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="Introduction_to_CSS">
        <header>Introduction to CSS</header>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Syntax">
        <header>CSS Syntax</header>
        <p>CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.</p>
        <p>For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:</p>
        <p class="lightgrey"><code><span class="left"><span class="purple">h1</span> {</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">color</span>: red;</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">font-size</span>: 5em;</span> <span class="left">}</span></code></p>
<ul>
  <li>In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings.</li>
  <li>We then have a set of curly braces<code>{ }</code></li>
  <li>Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. We specify the property (<code>color</code> in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (<code>red</code> in this example).</li>
  <li>This example contains two declarations, one for <code>color</code> and the other for <code>font-size</code>. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that we'd like to give the property.</li>
</ul>
<p>CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the <code>color</code> property, which can take various color values. We also have the <code>font-size</code> property. This property can take various size units as a value.</p>
<p>A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.</p>
<p class="lightgrey"><code><span class="left"><span class="purple">h1</span> {</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">color</span>: red;</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">font-size</span>: 5em;</span> <span class="left">}</span>
  <br><span class="left"><span class="purple">p</span> {</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">color</span>: black;</span> <span class="left">}</span></code></p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Introduction_to_JavaScript">
        <header>Introduction to JavaScript</header>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which HTML and CSS. </p>
        <img src="images/cake.png" />
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.</li>
          <li>CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="The_Three_Layer_built">
        <header>The Three Layer Built</header>
        <p>The three layers build on top of one another nicely. Let's take a button as an example. We can mark it up using HTML to give it structure and purpose:</p>
        <p><code>&lt;<span class="green">button</span> <span class="red">type</span>="<span class="green">button</span>"&gt;Player 1: Chris&lt;/<span class="green">button</span>&gt;
</code></p>
<img src="images/just-html.png" />
<p>Then we can add some CSS into the mix to get it looking nice:</p>
<p class="lightgrey"><code><span class="left"><span class="purple">button</span> {</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">font-family</span>: <span class="green">"helvetica neue"</span>, helvetica, sans-serif;</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">letter-spacing</span>: 1px;</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">text-transform</span>: uppercase;</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">border</span>: 2px solid <span class="red">rgb</span>(200 200 0 / 60%);</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">background-color</span>: <span class="red">rgb</span>(0 217 217 / 60%);</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">color</span>: <span class="red">rgb</span>(100 0 0 / 100%);</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">box-shadow</span>: 1px 1px 2px <span class="red">rgb</span>(0 0 200 / 40%);</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">border-radius</span>: 10px;</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">padding</span>: 3px 10px;</span> <span class="indent"><span class="red">cursor</span>: pointer;</span> <span class="left">}</span>
</code></p>
<img src="images/html-and-css.png" />
<p>And finally, we can add some JavaScript to implement dynamic behavior:</p>
<p class="lightgrey"><code><span class="left"><span class="blue">const</span> button = document.<span class="red">querySelector</span>(<span class="green">"button"</span>);</span><br>
<span class="left">button.<span class="red">addEventListener</span>(<span class="green">"click"</span>, updateName);</span><br>
<span class="left"><span class="blue">function</span> <span class="red">updateName</span>() {</span>
<span class="indent"><span class="blue">const</span> name = <span class="red">prompt</span>(<span class="green">"Enter a new name"</span>);</span>
  <span class="indent">button.textContent = <span class="purple">`Player 1:</span> ${name}`;</span>
<span class="left">}</span>
</code></p>
<p>When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be careful what order you put things in. For example, let's return to the block of JavaScript we saw in our first example.</p>
<p>Here we first select a button using <code>document.querySelector</code>, then attaching an event listener to it using <code>addEventListener</code> so that when the button is clicked, the <code>updateName()</code> code block (lines 5–8) is run. The <coe>updateName()</code> code block (these types of reusable code blocks are called "functions") asks the user for a new name, and then inserts that name into the button text to update the display.</p>
<p>If you swapped the order of the first two lines of code, it would no longer work — instead, you'd get an error returned in the browser developer console — <span>Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'button' before initialization</span>. This means that the <code>button</code> object has not been initialized yet, so we can't add an event listener to it. </p>
